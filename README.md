Make sure you download all the files and save them in the same folder.

**Just download a.exe and record.dat if you just want to only see the implementation.**

**Also the program can run only on Windows systems**

For Linux OS you need to change the system commands in the server and client files accordingly
_("rm" in place of "del" and "mv" in place of "ren")_
