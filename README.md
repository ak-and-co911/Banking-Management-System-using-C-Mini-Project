# Banking-Management-System-using-C-Mini-Project
A very simple simulation of banking mechanism. Hope you find it interesting.
Make sure you download all the files and save them in the same folder. 
Just download a.exe and record.dat if you just want to only see the implementation.
Also the program can run only on Windows systems
For Linux based OSs you need to change the system commands in the server and client files
